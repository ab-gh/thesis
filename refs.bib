      abstract = {The equations of motion of the particles in a synchrotron in which the field gradient index n=−(rB)∂B∂r varies along the equilibrium orbit are examined on the basis of the linear approximation. It is shown that if n alternates rapidly between large positive and large negative values, the stability of both radial and vertical oscillations can be greatly increased compared to conventional accelerators in which n is azimuthally constant and must lie between 0 and 1. Thus aperture requirements are reduced. For practical designs, the improvement is limited by the effects of constructional errors; these lead to resonance excitation of oscillations and consequent instability if 2νx or 2νz or νx + νz is integral, where νx and νz are the frequencies of horizontal and vertical betatron oscillations, measured in units of the frequency of revolution. The mechanism of phase stability is essentially the same as in a conventional synchrotron, but the radial amplitude of synchrotron oscillations is reduced substantially. Furthermore, at a “transition energy” E1 ≈ νxMc2 the stable and unstable equilibrium phases exchange roles, necessitating a jump in the phase of the radiofrequency accelerating voltage. Calculations indicate that the manner in which this jump is performed is not very critical.}

In chapter 10 we finally arrive at acceleration in a particle accelerator, with a detour to radio-frequency (RF) technology. The tour winds down with a discussion of applications of accelerators and future research. An introduction for graduate study should rather cover half the material at twice the depth—or all the material at twice the length.}",

The purpose of this report is to develop an analytical approach to this subject and to give relatively simple expressions useful for practical applications. The accuracy of this theory has been proved to be fairly good by numerical calculations. The analysis shows that better performance characteristics are expected for the third resonance ejection rather than the integer resonance ejection.}
