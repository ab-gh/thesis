6. p17: m_0 -> m * gamma_c * m_0. ✅
7. p17: "Bending angle" -> "bending radius" below eq2.10. ✅
8. p17: remove "/atomic mass unit". ✅
9. p17: Change unit syntax (https://www.nist.gov/pml/special-publication-811/nist-guide-si-chapter-7-rules-and-style-conventions-expressing-values) and add charge Z to equation.
10. p18: Changes figure 2.3 to up-pointing magnetic field.
11. p18: Clarify particle in figure 2.4 is moving out of the plane.
12. p18: Clarify sextupoles are used for chromaticity correction, not dispersion (dispersion is corrected by quadrupoles).
13. p19: Clarify particle in figure 2.5 is moving into the pane.
14. p20: Equation 2.18 incorrect (1/sqrt(beta) and -sin(...)).
15. p22: Add references to Matrix Formalism (2.1.9).
16. p23: Clarify matrix summation of eq2.35.
17. p23: Electric field and energy gain both use E_s, this is changed for clarity.
18. p23: Clarify synchronous condition eq2.40 (what about drift spaces? circumference is more than just 2\pi\rho. Factor 2pi is also wrong when using \omega_RF).
19. p24: "Eight stable 'particles'" -> "eight stable 'bunches'".
20. p24: Clarify 'R' in eq2.42 and 2.43 - might not be necessary.
21. p25: "rapidly gain energy" + "or lose".
22. p26: Reference sec 2.4 of PIMMS.
23. p26: Better argument for vertical transverse plane being neglected, as y is present (considered small?).
24. p27: eq2.60 (2/3) -> (3/2).
25. p28: A = 3 * sqrt(3) * h^2.
26. p29: Clarify amplitude-driven methods use RF at (i pm 1/3) f_rev.
27. p32: Ellipses in figure 2.12 are incorrect: trajectories should look like fig 2.8.
28. p34: Adds units: energy in eV, momentum in eV/c.
29. p36: Order of coupling resonances is assigned wrong colour.
30. p36: Units on 5.392 GeV.
31. p36: eq3.6: missing factor 2 - both plates carry current, total field is doubled
32. p36: eq3.7: missing charge q and speed of light c
33. p36: eq3.8: missing q
34. p37: Reformat units on axis labels in figure 3.3 (https://www.nist.gov/pml/special-publication-811/nist-guide-si-chapter-7-rules-and-style-conventions-expressing-values)
35. p37: Calculation of maximum deflection depends on momentum and charge - clarify for what beam this is calculated
36. p43: For debunched beams, emittance ellipses have no meaning for zeta.
37. p47: Add units for eq4.1.
38. p47: eq4.1 -> t/N_t = N_p *...
39. p58: clarify sample windows not turns in figure 4.12,
40. p58: Clarify what window size was used for spill duty factor measurements.
41. p58: Correct dashed ellipse shape (see comment to figure 2.12)
42. p62: "flat frequency structure" -> clarify the cutoff frequencies, etc. frequency structure is not flat
43. p62: State time resolution of detector, and window time used, to calculate spill duty factor
44. p63: last bullet point - there are no longitudinal dynamics in a coasting beam
45. Listing A.1 contains wrong equation with unit errors
46. A.1: line 16: -> sqrt(p**2 + (E_0/1e9)**2) not Brho
47. A.1: line 26: -> just use particle momentum p defined in the first place

# List of Amendments
1. Abstract: "profile.These" insert space ✅
2. p8: enumerate references in order they appear ???
3. p11: beam has been 'rotated' by a quarter turn -> clarify rotation in phase-space
4. p13: add brief paragraph to summarise the main aims of the dissertation, and what will be addressed in subsequent chapters
5. p14: fix reference
6. p17: fix sign difference in figure 2.3
7. p31: "hadrontherapy" insert space
8. p34: "single bunch, low intensity" clarify high intensity for a single bunch, but low intensity beam of just one bunch
9. p37: "maximum deflection of 10.814605" -> sig figs seems high
10. p53: "kHz in machine implementation and ..." missing "... in simulation"?
