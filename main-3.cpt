Phase-space distribution of the RFKO simulation at the \verb|SMH57| septum location, plotting all particles for the first 1000 turns (approx.\qty{2.128}{\milli\second} in lab time). RFKO driven by a transverse excitation frequency chirp across $f_{rev}/3$ at a \textit{rep-rate} of \qty{0.12}{\milli\second}. Color scale indicates turn number. Inset shows extracted particle distribution and a spiral step of $\Delta X_3\approx$\qty{6.1}{\milli\meter}.^^E^^L
