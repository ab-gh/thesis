% This work, and my research over the past 12 months at CERN, would not have been possible without the tutelage and support of my studentship supervisor, Yann. I would to thank him for his patience and guidance in turning a Bachelors student---without any formal background in Accelerator Physics---into a Master's candidate. I would also like to thank Matthew for his endless knowledge and assistance with my research and machine operation. 

% I would further like to thank my section colleagues---Eliott, Pablo, Francisco, Vittorio, and Rebecca R.---for their friendship and for welcoming me so warmly to ABT-BTP, my section and group leaders---Chiara and Wolfgang, colleagues across the campus---Emily, Rebecca T., the ABP, RF, BI, and OP-PS groups---and from among the wider community for their discussions, advice, and knowledge throughout my time at CERN.

% I would like to thank my academic supervisor, Stephen, for his encouragement to pursue this project.

% Finally, I would like to thank my family, friends, and loved ones for their support from hundreds of miles away.
