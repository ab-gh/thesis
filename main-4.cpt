Examples of initial distributions generated by \verb|Xsuite|, for number of particles $N_p=3000$, with parameters as shown in~\autoref{tab:initial-conditions}. Also plotted on each are the $1\sigma, 2\sigma, 3\sigma$ emittance ellipses, and the closed orbit particle (red). Top plots show transverse phase-space distribution for all simulation types. Bottom plots show longitudinal phase-space distribution for a \textit{bunched} (RF system active) beam (left) and \textit{debunched} (RF inactive) beam (right), simulated as a single bunch the length of the accelerator.^^E^^L
