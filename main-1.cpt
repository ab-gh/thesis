Optics plots of the closed orbit for the \verb|acc-models| PS East Area extraction scenario. Top figure shows horizontal closed orbit $x$, middle figure shows Twiss beta function $\beta$, and bottom figure shows transverse dispersion $D_x$. Also labelled are key extraction elements: the magnetic septa (\verb|SMH|), the extraction quadrupoles (\verb|QSE|), extraction sextupoles (\verb|XSE|), and kickers (\verb|BSW|)^^E^^L
