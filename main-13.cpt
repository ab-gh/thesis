Spill duty factor ($\mathcal{F}$) heatmaps for the RFKO system as measured in the machine, calculated with \qty{10}{\kilo\hertz} windows, both with a bunched beam (upper image) and coasting beam (lower image), as a function of chirp repetition frequency (log-scale) and voltage (linear). Colour scale represents $\mathcal{F}$.^^E^^L
